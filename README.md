# Sustainable finance (optimization problem)


As an example, I conducted a brief demonstration using a small set of assets (in this case, 5, but customizable to any desired number). The purpose was to showcase the difference when optimizing your portfolio. By employing a Scipy 'minimize' function, you can determine the ideal asset distribution to not only maximize returns but also minimize risk (minimum variance portfolio method).
